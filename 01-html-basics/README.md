1. ❓ What is the difference between <em> and <i>?
Answer:
Both display italic text, but:

<em> adds semantic meaning: emphasis (screen readers stress it).

<i> is purely for visual styling (used for icons, terms, etc.).

2. ❓ What is the difference between <strong> and <b>?
Answer:

<strong> means "important" and has semantic value.

<b> is only visual (bold text), no semantic meaning.

3. ❓ What are empty elements in HTML?
Answer:
Tags that do not have any content or closing tag.

 <br>, <hr>, <img>, <input>, <meta>, <link>
